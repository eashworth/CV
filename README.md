For fourteen years I was a wildlife detective for the UK’s biggest wildlife conservation charity, using the latest technology to catch criminals killing Scotland’s rarest species. My role brought me adventure, responsibility and the satisfaction of leveraging technological developments to bring vulnerable species back from the brink, but upon reaching a level of expertise where I was no longer required to learn at the same rate, I felt I had taken it as far as I could go. In search of new adventures applying technology to real-world challenges, I came to Makers and became a software engineer.

## Skills

#### Creative use of technology to solve real-world problems  

As a wildlife crime investigator, I became an expert in using the latest satellite-tracking equipment to recover the bodies of eagles for post-mortem examination, but faced the dual difficulty of being legally unable to place tracking equipment on potential criminal suspects, and having valuable surveillance equipment stolen. I took advantage of the situation by building motion-triggered VHF/GPS/GSM trackers and redundant power supplies into the surveillance equipment, enabling me to monitor the movement of the equipment and therefore the whereabouts of anyone who stole it.

#### Information security, data protection and intuitive database design

As a crime investigator, I handled sensitive personal data identifying suspects and witnesses, including vulnerable whistle-blowers, and restricted data used in police investigations. A key part of this was advising on successive designs of input forms for an intelligence database, refining the use of compulsory fields, multiple-choice inputs and on-screen prompts to ensure that records were accurate and compliant with security protocols and data protection requirements. I advised the police on the design of a national standard for incident recording. My experience means I know what it takes to build a system that its users can trust.

#### Leadership, communication and teaching others

I am an empathetic, authoritative communicator with an ability to adapt my style to widely differing audiences, having:

- represented a national wildlife charity at meetings with a government minster
- sat on a scientific working group developing forensic techniques
- trained Panamanian police in wildlife-tracking and navigation, in Spanish
- briefed a police search team on chemical safety procedures before a dawn raid
- explained to a chief inspector how his officers could progress an investigation
- gained the trust of whistle-blowers reporting the criminal activities of their employer
- presented scientific findings at a police conference
- educated American schoolchildren in bird identification
- supervised six new volunteers in practical nature reserve management tasks every week
- welcomed the public to a nature reserve, making sure they understood how to stay safe
- treated and reassured a colleague who accidentally stuck a Stanley knife in his thigh
- performed stand-up comedy at Scotland’s most famous comedy clubs, and got laughs

#### Determination, driven by curiosity

When something piques my curiosity, I am driven to explore it and find a way forward. E.g., when my employer offered me a month’s sabbatical to work abroad, I qualified as a tree-climber, spent a year and a half teaching myself Russian, attended a conference with the vice-president of a Siberian national park and joined their expedition counting bears and climbing into eagle nests for a Russian TV documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJWTZRxjWoY
